    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last Updated: Jan 20, 2025</em></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>Feelr</strong> (the “App”). Your privacy is very important to me. This Privacy Policy explains how I, the sole developer of Feelr (“I”, “me”, or “my”), handle information collected through the mobile application. I am committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies only to data collected through the App and not to any data collected offline or via any other means.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Data I Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Feelr does <strong>not</strong> collect any personally identifiable information (PII). Specifically:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I do not collect names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, or any other data that would directly or indirectly identify you.</li>
      <li>I do not track or store personal data without your consent.</li>
      <li>I do not use cookies or similar tracking technologies within the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Non-Personal Data</h2>
    <p>
      While Feelr does not collect PII, the app may collect non-personal or anonymous data to help improve its performance and the user experience. This information may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device information (e.g., device type, operating system)</li>
      <li>App usage statistics (e.g., feature usage patterns, error logs)</li>
      <li>Analytics data that has been stripped of any identifiers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This information is used solely to analyze and improve app functionality and does not allow me to identify you personally.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Feelr may contain links to third-party websites or services. I do not control these websites and am not responsible for their privacy practices. I encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      I implement reasonable security measures to protect any data processed by Feelr. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. If you have any concerns about the security of the app, please contact me using the information provided below.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Feelr is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If I learn that I have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, I will take steps to delete that information promptly.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If any changes are made, the updated policy will be posted on this page with a new “Last Updated” date. I encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
    </p>
